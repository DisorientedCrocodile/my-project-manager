# my-project-manager
This is a tkinter app that shows your projects. You will be able to change the status of these projects.

# How to use
To open the program, download the .zip file, extract it somewhere and open it. There, you'll need to find the `ProjectManager v1.1.1.exe` file. Open it and choose your 'projects' folder. Don't be afraid of the "Failed to execute script main" error. That's supposed to happen :-)
Restart the program and you're all set!
